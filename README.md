Learning Project - A simple RSS Feed Reader

This simple RSS feed reader was made as a learning project for myself.
It uses JSON to save bookmarks, which is of course not necessary but still was a good learning experience for me.

The release version has JSON integrated inside of the executable, so you do not need the NewtonSoft.Json.dll together
with it.

This application supports reading RSS feeds, with dates published, titles and descriptions.
Double clicking the feed Title/Date Published will open the actual page in your standard web browser.

This RSS Feed Reader supports bookmarking of your favorite feeds.
